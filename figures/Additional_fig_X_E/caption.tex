E) Assembly metrics for various genomes

Raw assembly metrics are plotted along the x-axis with density on the y-axis. Plots include a density histogram (blue) and a smooth density estimate (black line). The x-axis value for the Tcas5.0 draft assembly is also indicated (dashed black line).

In all plots the Tcas5.0 draft assembly is on the higher end of the distribution indicating that the initial draft assembly was relatively high quality and that the results of molecule map assembly and super scaffolding were also relatively high quality. In no plot was the Tcas5.0 draft assembly in the highest value bin.
